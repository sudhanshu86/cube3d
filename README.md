# cube3d
Simulating a cube in 3d using c++
------------------------------------------
#Instructions to run the assignment

Please copy the cube3d folder to your system

go to folder--> raytrace

The first time before you build the code for Linux, you will need to grant permission to run the build script as an executable:

chmod +x build
And finally, build the code:

./build

This results in the executable file "raytrace" in the current directory

Run the raytrace program with "run" command line option

./raytrace run

this should save 6 cube .png images in the output folder.

--------------------------------------------------

Please note that I am not the author of the files lodepng.h and lodepng.cpp for writing PNG formatted image files
